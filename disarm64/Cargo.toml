description = """
disarm64 provides a tool and a library for decoding ARM64 instructions (at least 250 MiB/sec
of the decoding speed is delivered on a laptop that is used for development). Here you will
also find a utility for generating disassembler/instruction decoder tables in Rust from
a JSON file. Besides that, can visualize the instruction decoding as a tree.
